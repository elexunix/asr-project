I have implemented the steps of the instruction, also beam search and beam search with LM (using 3rd party lib). The metrics of BSwLM are significantly better than those without.

I have a total of 176 wanbd runs, though most of them were interrupted early. Here is the summary of the most successful ones (BS\&LM metrics not present here, only plain model):

I claim a 0.189 test-clean WER, please check output.json, the output of test.py.

More precisely, I have:

Please check the graphs and all the statistics of my runs in wandb, the relevant ones are listen at the first picture.

If you want to reproduce and run train.py and test.py yourself, please check the readme file.
